# Background Location

Small app which sends location data to server.

## Testing
The simulator has an option that lets you simulate a bike ride through the city.

## TODO
- [ ] UI to set a battery saving mode that does not send the location too often
- [ ] log view

## Server
```
npm i -g nodemon
cd server
nodemon
```
Will start server on port 3000
